My solutions to the assignments.

Description of problem sets:
 - ps0 : Just to confirm python is installed.
 - ps1 : A tool to calculate what percent of your salary you should save to pay something(say downpayment) in a given time(say 3 years).
 - ps2 : Classic game of hangman.
 - ps3 : A word game whose scoring is like scrabble.
 - ps4 : Encrypter and Decrypter for Caesar and Substitution ciphers
 - ps5 : A tool to filter latest news stories according to user preferences

Note : In ps5, the feedparser was unable to parse yahoo news due to attribute error - specifically the entry had no attribute description. So, I have commented it out.
